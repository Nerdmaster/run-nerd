Run, Nerd!

This was a flash game I started working on sometime around 2005-2007 and which
was about 90% complete.  For whatever reason, I never put in the time to finish
it, and as Flash began to decline I found myself less and less interested in
completing the game.

The game is actually essentially playable, there's just no instructions, and it
doesn't really go anywhere - you just build words until you lose.  There was a
*ton* I wanted to get around to adding, and that huge to-do list is at least
part of the reason I never finished.  I wanted to release something complete
instead of yet another "meh" game of mine.  The terrible irony here is that
because I wanted something amazing, I became too paralyzed to tackle the huge
list of tasks, and ended up releasing nothing at all.

Learn from me, kids.

Don't get too excited.

Yes, I did leave a lot of "sensitive" info in this repo.  But it's all so old
that none of it is relevant.  Not the path names (and, yes, I did indeed used
to run my site from `~/`), not the facebook api key, nothing.  Heck, even stuff
embedded in the .fla files isn't going to have any value anymore.  Hell, even
if I had the root database password somewhere (I don't), it wouldn't be useful
anymore.
